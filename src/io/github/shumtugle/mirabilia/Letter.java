/**
 * Type as a ladder of fifteen rungs.
 *
 * Five kinds of words, three sizes each: display for the name of a room,
 * headline for the name of a screen, title for the name of a thing, body
 * for what is said about it, label for what is pressed. Each rung fixes a
 * size, the height of a line, a weight and the air between letters, so a
 * word set on a rung looks the same wherever it stands.
 *
 * The two upper kinds are set in the platform's serif. A collection is a
 * kind of museum, and a museum labels its rooms in a book face; everything
 * a finger touches stays in the plain sans, where it is read fastest.

     * whatever length, and a rung nailed down pays for its steadiness with
     * a word cut through the middle. So the rung gives way instead: the
     * name is measured against the width the view was given, and takes the
     * first rung of the ladder on which it stands in one line. It is a
     * ladder and not a slope — three sizes the type already has, not a
     * size computed for this one name — so a plate still looks like the
     * other plates. Below the last rung the name takes two lines and ends
     * in an ellipsis rather than pushing what is under it off the screen.
     *
     * The line it turns on is the name's own: it is aligned by the writing
     * it is in and not by the writing of the application, so a name that
     * runs the other way stands at the other edge.
     *
     * Measured again at every change of width, set only when the rung
     * changes — setting asks for a new layout, and a rung that answered
     * would ask again.
