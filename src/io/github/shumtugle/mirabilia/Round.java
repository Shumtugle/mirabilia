/**
 * Shape as a short scale, not as numbers chosen on the spot.
 *
 * Seven steps, from square to a full capsule. A small thing that is touched
 * gets a small radius, a large surface a large one, and anything that is a
 * button is a capsule whatever its size. A corner that is not on the scale
 * is a corner someone forgot to think about.
 *
 * Press feedback lives here as well, because it is part of the shape: it is
 * clipped to the thing that was pressed and drawn in the ink that thing
 * already wears, thinned, so a press is seen rather than shouted.
