 * being handed all of it at once. What leaves goes in two hundred, slow to
 * start and gone at speed, the mirror of an arrival. A press answers in a
 * hundred and forty.

 * Nothing moves faster than a press or slower than an arrival. Anything
 * quicker is not seen; anything slower is waited for.
